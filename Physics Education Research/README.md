# Physics Education Research

## **What is Physics Education Research?**

> Physics education research is a form of discipline-based education research specifically related to the study of the teaching and learning of physics, often with the aim of improving the effectiveness of student learning. Approximately eighty-five institutions in the United States conduct research in science and physics education.

In my undergraduate studies I was a Physics Education Researcher where I spent my time analyzing the effectiveness of certain instructional pedagogies on student performance, sentiment analysis on students perceptions of the physics-math intersection in quantum mechanics and the analysis of how demographics affect student performance (e.g. gender/racial gaps in student performance).

I did my research work under **Dr. Qing Ryan** & **Dr. Homeyra Sadaghiani** & **Dr. Benjamin P. Schermerhorn**. Contact information can be found [here](https://www.cpp.edu/sci/physics-astronomy/research/physics-astronomy-education-research.shtml).
