## **What is Physics Education Research?**

> Physics education research is a form of discipline-based education research specifically related to the study of the teaching and learning of physics, often with the aim of improving the effectiveness of student learning. Approximately eighty-five institutions in the United States conduct research in science and physics education.

In my undergraduate studies I was a Physics Education Researcher where I spent my time analyzing the effectiveness of certain instructional pedagogies on student performance, sentiment analysis on students perceptions of the physics-math intersection in quantum mechanics and the analysis of how demographics affect student performance (e.g. gender/racial gaps in student performance).

I did my research work under **Dr. Qing Ryan** & **Dr. Homeyra Sadaghiani** & **Dr. Benjamin P. Schermerhorn**. Contact information can be found [here](https://www.cpp.edu/sci/physics-astronomy/research/physics-astronomy-education-research.shtml).

### Statistical Analysis of Students’ Performance On Research-based Inventory

**Abstract**

> The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) is an important diagnostic tool widely utilized within the PER (Physics Education Research) community. While students’ performance on the FCI has been extensively studied, relatively less work was done in primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) and minority-serving institutions. As part of an effort to provide evidence for the reproducibility of educational studies for a variety of student body as well exploring possible gender or racial gaps in student’s performance, data was collected over a year-long period for a number of introductory physics courses at Cal Poly Pomona (both a PUI and Hispanic serving institution) to understand factors that affect students’ performance on the FCI. In this work, we discuss background variables that predict students’ FCI scores at the end of the term. This baseline measure can be used for any future studies conducted at our institution to evaluate the effectiveness of any pedagogical reforms. We will also explore possible gender or racial gaps for our student body.

### [Students’ Perceptions of the Math-Physics Interactions Throughout Spins-First Quantum Mechanics](https://www.compadre.org/per/items/detail.cfm?ID=15323) (Paper Linked)

**Abstract**

> One of the purported benefits of teaching a spins-first approach to quantum mechanics is that it allows students to build up quantum mechanical ideas and learn postulates before moving to the more complicated mathematics used in the context of wave functions. In order to begin to explore this claim in a spins-first course, a survey was developed and administered as an extra credit activity at three different universities. All three universities teach spins-first quantum mechanics with interactive methods. This work compares students' responses to identical questions about the relationship between and difficulty of math and physics from two administrations of the survey given at the ends of the spins and wave functions portions of the course. Results offer insight into students' perspectives about the nature and difficulty of mathematics in these two paradigms of quantum mechanics.
