# Darwin Agunos - Personal Project Portfolio

### Background
Hello! My name is Darwin Agunos and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at Cal Poly Pomona where I majored in Physics with an emphasis on applications computational sciences. In my undergraduate studies I was a Physics Education Researcher where I spent my time analyzing the effectiveness of certain instructional pedagogies on student performance, sentiment analysis on students perceptions of the physics-math intersection in quantum mechanics and the analysis of how demographics affect student performance (e.g. gender/racial gaps in student performance).
