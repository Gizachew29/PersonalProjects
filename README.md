# Darwin Agunos - Personal Project Portfolio

## Background

Hello! 

My name is Darwin Agunos and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at Cal Poly Pomona where I majored in Physics with an emphasis on applications computational sciences. In my undergraduate studies I was a Physics Education Researcher where I spent my time analyzing the effectiveness of certain instructional pedagogies on student performance, sentiment analysis on students perceptions of the physics-math intersection in quantum mechanics and the analysis of how demographics affect student performance (e.g. gender/racial gaps in student performance). 

### Introduction

This repository holds all the work that I've done over the years. Currently they're binned in three different categories

1. Personal Programming Projects
    - Python
      - Data Science
      - Scripts
      - Software Development
2. CPP Education Research Posters
3. Public Tableau Visualizations

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by a readme.
