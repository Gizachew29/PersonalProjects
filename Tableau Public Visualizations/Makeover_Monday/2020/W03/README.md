- Over the past decade, smoking has become marginalised and stigmatised.
- From the smoking ban in 2007 to the introduction of plain packaging a decade later, everything has been done to discourage people from taking up the habit. And there are signs sugar is heading the same way.
- People of all ages are consuming **twice** of the recommended daily free sugar percentage
- Sugary drinks are already taxed - and now a leading think tank has even suggested sweets, snacks and sugary drinks should be wrapped in plain packaging to make them less appealing, given the excess consumption of the sweet stuff.
