## What I Did

By Worksheet :

1. Blend Data, Make state codes and used a GROUP for European Union. Used a blended dataset
2. For Brazil and China I used Original Data Set.
3. Create a bar graph with original dataset. 
4. To get black background use Map Layers, take out stuff as needed. Make worksheet background black.


## WHAT I LEARNED :

- Make a group with country codes to do a "custom territory"
- Aggregate based on count.
- Blend data
- Use different data sources
- How to make a dashboard.
