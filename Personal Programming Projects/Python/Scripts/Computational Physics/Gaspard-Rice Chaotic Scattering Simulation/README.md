My implementation of Chaotic Scattering in the Gaspard-Rice System. In this work we explore the themes of [chaotic scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaotic_scattering) and [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal).

> The “Gaspard-Rice” (GR) scattering system is an excellent system that embodies many characteristics of chaotic scattering while being simple and easy to understand and simulate. One interesting way to look for a qualitative behavior of chaos in this system is to plot the exit angle θ vs input ordinate. One internet article by study engineer Fabien Dournac1 has shown chaotic output for the GR scattering system. The Wikipedia2 page also claims that the decay rate of particles exiting the system, γ,  is- 0.739. Our purpose here is to compare the results with our GR scattering system and determine if these claim are true. We will also plot the input ordinate vs bounces in a trajectory and time spent per trajectory, verify chaotic nature and find the fractal dimensions of our results as a bonus.

## Appearance of Fractal Behavior
