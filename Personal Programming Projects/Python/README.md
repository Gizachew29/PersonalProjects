# Python Projects

## Introduction

Python was the first programming language I ever learned. At first I used it for simulating physical phenomena but I transitioned into using
Python as a data analysis tool when I became a Physics Education Researcher. Since then I've worked on numerous personal projects in different kinds of work.
This repository holds some of the work that I have completed. 

# Project Examples

## Data Science
[<h3 align = "left">Project: Introductory Machine Learning Benchmarks for Neuro ICU Patients on the eICU Critical Care Dataset</h3>](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Data%20Science/eICU/Project%201)
<h4 align=center> Mortality Predictions </h4>

**Mortality model prediction metric scores.** Classification models are matched up against APACHE IV / APACHE IVa predictions. Classification models were cross-validated 1000 times. We report the mean metric score and the standard deviation over all 1000 iterations. \*Note that standard deviation scores are not available for the APACHE prediction models.
#### Project At A Glance
- The APACHE (Acute Physiological And Chronic Health Evaluation) IV/IVa is a tool used to risk-adjust ICU patients for ICU performance benchmarking and quality improvement analysis but it was last improved in 2006. Can we create prediction models that beat these tasks?
- Project Tools: **Python** (libraries: Altair, sklearn, numpy, pandas, psycopg2), **PostgreSQL**.
- Dataset: [eICU Critical Care Dataset](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/) [(31 Tables, 457,325,320 rows, 50 gb)](https://mit-lcp.github.io/eicu-schema-spy/)
- [Academic Style Report](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/blob/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Data%20Science/eICU/Project%201/Introductory%20Machine%20Learning%20Benchmarks%20for%20Neuro%20ICU%20Patients%20on%20the%20eICU%20Critical%20Care%20Dataset.pdf)

#### Project At A Glance
- EDA Project exploring real student data in a college kinematics course. Data has been de-identified.
- Goal: Explore characteristics that could potentially impact a student's physics grade and understanding of Newtonian Mechanics
- Alternative Project: [Early Student Failure Detection Algorithm](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/edit/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Data%20Science/Early%20Student%20Failure%20Detection%20Algorithm/README.md)
