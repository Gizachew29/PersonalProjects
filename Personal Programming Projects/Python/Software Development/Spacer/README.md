# Spacer

**Spacer** is a study solution used to help make learning more effective. Spacer utilitizes the [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect) that was first identified by *Hermann Ebbinghaus*. The spacing effect demonstrates that learning is more effective when study sessions are spaced out. Spaced out study sessions shows that more information is encoded into long-term memory by spaced study sessions.
