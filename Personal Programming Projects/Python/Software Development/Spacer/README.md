**Spacer** is a study solution used to help make learning more effective. Spacer utilitizes the [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect) that was first identified by *Hermann Ebbinghaus*. The spacing effect demonstrates that learning is more effective when study sessions are spaced out. Spaced out study sessions shows that more information is encoded into long-term memory by spaced study sessions. Spacer manages your study sessions utilizing the *spacing effect* to help encode information into long-term memory. This allows the user to spend their time more efficiently on different tasks. 

## Features
- Study Session Scheduler: Utilizing the spacing effect we automatically set schedule sections for each task.
- Effective Learning: Honor-based level system indicating your strength in a subject.
- Database: With a SQLite Database in the backend you can always come back to the application with all your data saved!
- Note Tracker: Keep notes on your task for when you study so that you have everything in front of you.

## Features To Add
- Study Sessions: Add a time management method (most likely [Pomodoro](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/03/03/the-pomodoro-technique/#18f7d5fc3985)) that will be utilized during study sessions.
