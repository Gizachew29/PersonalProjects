# Programming Projects

I was introduced to programming towards the latter of my undergraduate program. I learned how to use Python to simulate physical phenomena and write reports on that phenomena. This branch of physics is known as Computational Physics and it is one way to bridge the gap between theoretical and computational physics. From here I began using my programming skills for Data Analaysis during my time as a student Physics Education Researcher ([Link To My Work])(https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Physics%20Education%20Research). 

I've grown a love for programming over the years and have tried out data analysis projects, software development projects and web development projects. This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done as a programmer. Currently categorized by programming language and sub-categorized by project type.
